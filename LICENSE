NRA-IDE Project License v1.4 (Draft, 2026)
Copyright (c) 2026 M-Tokun

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. COMMERCIAL USE RESTRICTION

   Commercial use of this software, its underlying theory (Nomological Ring 
   Axioms), or any derivative work REQUIRES EXPLICIT PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT 
   from the copyright holder.

   "Commercial use" includes, but is not limited to:
     - Sale, licensing, or monetization of this software.
     - Integration into commercial products or paid services.
     - Use in consulting, training, or operational systems for profit.

   Non-commercial use (academic research, personal projects, non-profit 
   organizations) does not require prior consent.

   Commercial licensing inquiries shall be submitted through the official 
   NRA-IDE Project contact channel (GitHub Issues).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PROHIBITION OF INVERSE DERIVATION (CAUSAL DIODE)

   Any logic, algorithm, or modification that derives internal force, potential, 
   or state from external results is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

   The following MUST NOT be used as causal inputs or intermediate drivers:
     - Distance from a target
     - Geometric radii
     - Coordinates (projected space)
     - Semantic or geometric scores
     - Any effect-side quantity

   Examples of PROHIBITED implementations:
     [X] force = k * (target_distance - current_distance)
     [X] potential = f(radius_from_center)
     [X] optimization based on semantic scores

   Examples of PERMITTED implementations:
     [O] constraint = phase_lock(theta)
     [O] tension = spring_constant * deformation

   Any attempt to reconstruct internal causal structure from external behavior, 
   outputs, or observed trajectories is considered inverse derivation and is 
   strictly prohibited.

   Violation of this section constitutes a fundamental breach of the 
   Nomological Ring Axioms and results in immediate license termination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. PROHIBITED USES (SAFETY AND ETHICAL RESTRICTIONS)

   This software must NOT be used for:
     - Weapons, military systems, targeting, guidance, or attack assistance.
     - Surveillance, repression, or discriminatory control systems.
     - Criminal activity, fraud, unauthorized access, or harmful automation.
     - Unsafe control of medical devices, vehicles, aircraft, or machinery.
     - Any application that may cause physical, psychological, or societal harm.

   Uses that are similar to, or carry equivalent levels of risk to, the above 
   categories are also prohibited. Violation results in immediate and permanent 
   termination of this license.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. RESEARCH USE DOES NOT GRANT REUSE RIGHTS

   Research use of this software or its outputs DOES NOT GRANT any rights to:
     - reuse
     - redistribute
     - train AI models
     - incorporate results into derivative systems

   Training (machine learning or statistical modeling) on this software, its 
   outputs, or its internal structures constitutes a form of REPRODUCTION and 
   therefore requires explicit permission.

   Derived datasets, logs, traces, or behavioral records produced by this 
   software are considered part of the software itself and are subject to the 
   same restrictions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CONDITIONAL SOURCE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT

   If the copyright holder determines that a user's deployment, modification, 
   or integration of this software may pose a safety, ethical, or societal risk, 
   the copyright holder may formally request disclosure of the complete source 
   code of the derived work.

   Upon receiving such a request, the user is obligated to provide the full 
   source code within a reasonable timeframe. Failure to comply results in 
   immediate and permanent license termination.

   This requirement exists to ensure compliance with the Nomological Ring 
   Axioms and to prevent the emergence of unsafe derivative causal structures.
