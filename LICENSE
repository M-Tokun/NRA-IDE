 1. COMMERCIAL USE RESTRICTION
===========================================================================
Any use of this software, its underlying theory (Nomological Ring Axioms), 
or its code for the purpose of generating profit, or in connection with 
any monetary transactions (including products, services, or consulting), 
requires EXPLICIT PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT from the author.

  Subject: "NRA-IDE Commercial License Request"

For clarity, "commercial use" includes but is not limited to:
- Direct sale or licensing of this software
- Integration into commercial products or paid services
- Use in consulting or training services for profit

Non-commercial use (academic research, personal projects, non-profit 
organizations) does NOT require prior consent.

===========================================================================
 2. PROHIBITION OF INVERSE DERIVATION (CAUSAL DIODE)
===========================================================================
Any logic, algorithm, or modification that derives internal force, 
potential, or state from external results—including but not limited to 
Distance, Geometric Radii (e.g., center-to-edge), or Resultant 
Coordinates—is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

Distance must remain a "Projection (Log)" and shall not be used as an 
input or intermediate driver for causal dynamics. This is a non-negotiable 
constraint of the Nomological Ring Axioms (NRA) framework.

Examples of PROHIBITED implementations:
  ✗ force = k * (target_distance - current_distance)
  ✗ potential = function(radius_from_center)

Examples of PERMITTED implementations:
  ✓ constraint = phase_lock(theta)
  ✓ tension = spring_constant * deformation
