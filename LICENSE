## **1. Commercial Use Restriction**

Commercial use of this software, its underlying theory (Nomological Ring Axioms), or any derivative work **requires explicit prior written consent** from the copyright holder.

“Commercial use” includes, but is not limited to:  
- Sale, licensing, or monetization of this software  
- Integration into commercial products or paid services  
- Use in consulting, training, or operational systems for profit  

Non‑commercial use (academic research, personal projects, non‑profit organizations) **does not require prior consent**.

Commercial licensing inquiries shall be submitted through the official NRA‑IDE Project contact channel.  
Contact information will be provided upon request.

## **2. Prohibition of Inverse Derivation (Causal Diode)**

Any logic, algorithm, or modification that derives internal force, potential, or state from external results is **strictly prohibited**.

The following **must not** be used as causal inputs or intermediate drivers:  
- Distance  
- Geometric radii  
- Coordinates  
- Projected quantities  
- Semantic or geometric scores  
- Any effect‑side quantity  

Examples of prohibited implementations:  
- force = k * (target_distance − current_distance)  
- potential = f(radius_from_center)  
- optimization based on semantic or geometric scores  

Examples of permitted implementations:  
- constraint = phase_lock(theta)  
- tension = spring_constant * deformation  

Violation of this section constitutes a breach of the Nomological Ring Axioms and results in immediate license termination.

## **3. Prohibited Uses (Safety and Ethical Restrictions)**

This software must **not** be used for:  
- Weapons, military systems, targeting, guidance, or attack assistance  
- Surveillance, repression, or discriminatory control systems  
- Criminal activity, fraud, unauthorized access, or harmful automation  
- Unsafe control of medical devices, vehicles, aircraft, or machinery  
- Any application that may cause physical, psychological, or societal harm  

Uses that are similar to, or carry equivalent levels of risk to, the above categories are also prohibited.

Violation results in immediate and permanent termination of this license.

## **4. Research Use Does Not Grant Reuse Rights**

Research use of this software or its outputs **does not grant** any rights to:  
- reuse  
- redistribute  
- train AI models  
- incorporate results into derivative systems  

Training (machine learning or statistical modeling) on this software, its outputs, or its internal structures constitutes a form of **reproduction** and therefore requires explicit permission.

Unauthorized training or integration results in immediate license termination.

## **5. Conditional Source Disclosure Requirement**

If the copyright holder determines that a user’s deployment, modification, or integration of this software may pose a safety, ethical, or societal risk, the copyright holder may formally request disclosure of the complete source code of the derived work.

Upon receiving such a request, the user is obligated to provide the full source code within a reasonable timeframe.

Failure to comply results in immediate and permanent license termination.

This clause exists to prevent:  
- weaponization  
- unsafe or opaque modifications  
- harmful or deceptive deployments
