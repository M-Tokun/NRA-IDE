4. THE CAUSAL DIODE CLAUSE:
   Modifications that enable "Inverse Kinematics" (calculating Force from Distance)
   or "Causal Reversal" are PROHIBITED to protect the integrity of the physics.
   The software must maintain the unidirectional flow from Cause to Effect.

5. THE FAIL-CLOSED CLAUSE:
   Safety mechanisms (Threshold Handlers) must not be bypassed.
   Systems must halt or alert upon violation, rather than auto-correcting with fake data.
