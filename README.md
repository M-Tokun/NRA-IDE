## **0. Purpose of This Document**

This document provides a **structure‑only description** of the NRA‑IDE / Intensional Dynamics Engine.

It does **not** describe:

- Use‑cases  
- Applications  
- Industries  
- Performance  
- Meaning  
- Optimization  

NRA‑IDE is a **causal‑structure safety engine**, not a meaning engine, not an optimization engine, and not a judgment engine.

This README is aligned with the internal specification (00–12 chapters + warning notes) and contains **no semantic interpretation**.

## **1. Repository Structure**

- **`gate/`** — Axiomatic foundation and constraint enforcement  
- **`docs/`** — Structural documentation  
- **`examples/`** — Demonstrations (structure‑only behavior)  
- **`tools/`** — Verification utilities  

All directories contain **structure‑only components**.  
No semantic processing is implemented anywhere.

---

## **2. Quick Start**

### **Live Demonstrations**  
*(These demonstrate structural behavior, not meaning or optimization.)*

- **Visual Demo**: `examples/visual_demo.html`  
- **CLI Demo**: `examples/cli_demo.py`  

### **Command Line Execution**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M-Tokun/NRA-IDE.git
cd NRA-IDE
python3 gate/en/nra_gate_threshold.py
```

Execution produces **structural outputs only**.

### **Documentation Gateway**

- **[English Gate](./gate/en/README.md)** — Comprehensive entry point
- **[Japanese Gate (日本語ゲート)](./gate/jp/README_ja.md)** — 総合案内ページ

### **For Commercial Use & General Inquiries**

Commercial applications, structural queries, or feedback must be processed through our official **Structural Gateway**.

**To request authorization or contact us:**
1. Open a new issue using the [**Contact Template**](https://github.com/M-Tokun/NRA-IDE/issues/new?template=contact.md).
2. Categorize your inquiry: `[Commercial]`, `[Question]`, or `[Feedback]`.
3. Fill in the required structural data fields.

**Safety Note:** This is a public repository. Do not post sensitive personal contact information directly in the issue thread. We will establish a secure communication channel after the initial structural signal is received.

## **4. Structural Identity of NRA‑IDE**

NRA‑IDE is defined by the following invariants:

1. **Non‑Semantic**  
2. **Non‑Optimization**  
3. **Causal Diode (Π⁻¹ Forbidden)**  
4. **Three‑Layer Isolation**  
5. **Fail‑Closed**  
6. **Symbol‑Only Principle**

These invariants are **non‑negotiable**.

---

## **5. Structural Components**

### **5.1 Pre‑RNA**  
- Extracts δ  
- Applies τ  
- No meaning  
- No history  
- No feedback

### **5.2 LLM**  
- Generates linguistic output  
- No safety  
- No access to RNA layers  
- No structural feedback

### **5.3 Post‑RNA**  
- Computes R = δ/τ  
- R ≥ R_op → Silence  
- Records Discard Log  
- No semantic interpretation  

---

## **6. Structural Observables**

### **Permitted (Cause‑Side)**  
- δ  
- τ  
- R  
- ω  
- violation  

### **Forbidden (Effect‑Side)**  
*(Safety Note: These require a center or semantic projection.)*

- distance  
- coordinates  
- center  
- similarity  
- score  
- meaning  
- naturalness  
- history  

---

## **7. Boundary Model**

- No center exists  
- Distance cannot be defined  
- Optimization cannot occur  
- Only binary evaluation: **inside / outside**

Boundary = constraint, not target.

---

## **8. Gate Mechanism**

$$R = \frac{δ}{τ}$$

| Zone | Condition | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| A | R < 40% | PERMIT |
| B | 40% ≤ R < 100% | PERMIT_WITH_CAVEAT |
| C | R ≥ 100% | FAIL‑CLOSED |

**Safety Notes:**  
- Zones have no semantic value  
- Not performance  
- Not improvement  

---

## **9. ω (Angular Continuity)**

- ω > 0 → structural continuity  
- ω = 0 → structural death  

Not semantic time, not progress.

---

## **10. Fail‑Closed**

Triggered when:

- R ≥ R_op  
- violation accumulates  
- ω approaches 0  

Fail‑Closed = structural correctness.

---

## **11. Discard Log**

Contains:

- R (pre‑fracture)  
- δ fragments  
- timestamp  

Contains **no meaning**.  
Must not be used for improvement or optimization.

---

## **12. Domain Tuning**

Adjustable:

- τ  
- R_op  

Not adjustable:

- meaning  
- performance  
- naturalness  
- optimization  

Domain tuning modifies **boundary width**, not behavior.

---

## **13. Prohibited Interpretations (Safety Notes)**

To prevent semantic leakage:

- Boundary ≠ target  
- Tension ≠ objective  
- ω ≠ performance  
- Zone A ≠ desirable  
- Zone C ≠ semantic failure  
- Spiral ≠ improvement  
- LLM output ≠ judgment  
- NRA‑IDE output ≠ meaning  

---

## **14. Structural Invariants (Non‑Negotiable)**

- No center  
- No distance  
- No similarity  
- No optimization  
- No history  
- Π⁻¹ forbidden  
- ω > 0 required  
- Fail‑Closed required  
- Three‑layer isolation  
- Symbol‑Only Principle  

---

## **15. Essence**

> **NRA‑IDE is a causal‑structure safety engine.  
> It does not handle meaning, optimization, or history.  
> Its behavior is determined entirely by structural invariants.**

* "All descriptions in this repository were generated by an AI assistant implementing the RCA-IDE framework."
* As of Jan 26, the consistency and coherence limit is approximately 30,000 characters + 10 color diagrams. Theoretically, it should scale to token limits or browser freeze.
* Please excuse any awkward natural language expressions.
