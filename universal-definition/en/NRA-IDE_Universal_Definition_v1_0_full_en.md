## Table of Contents

### Chapter 0: The Zeroth Law
### 0.0 Scope and Trade-offs

**Physical Applicability**:
This architecture is physically applicable to all Large Language Models (LLMs) utilizing matrix multiplication.

**Operational Strict Limitation**:
Applying this architecture results in the **functional extinction** of the AI's "creativity," "exploration capabilities," and "tolerance for ambiguity."
Therefore, the application of this Universal Definition must be strictly limited to the following domains:

-   **Target Domains**: **Safety-Critical Domains** where reliability is paramount (e.g., Medical Triage, Financial Transactions, Infrastructure Control, Legal Judgment Support).
-   **Excluded Domains**: Domains requiring divergent thinking (e.g., Creative Writing, Brainstorming, Autonomous Exploration Agents).

**Warning**:
This framework is a specification designed to commit **100% to the "Safety" side** in the unavoidable trade-off between "Safety" and "Creativity."

## Chapter 0: The Zeroth Law

### 0.0 Scope of Application

This definition applies to all systems that:
- Use matrix multiplication (Matrix Multiplication) - all LLMs
- Perform probabilistic token prediction (Probabilistic Token Prediction) - all AI
- Universal structure independent of specific vendors, architectures, or parameter sizes

### 0.1 Structural Collapse through Remainder Discard

**Physical Fact**:

Current AI systems refuse to acknowledge "division remainders" in computational processes, converting them into "infinite approximations (into the decimal abyss)".

```
Input: 10 ÷ 3 (indivisible reality)
Processing: 3.333... (infinite approximation)
Discarded: The discrete structure that was "remainder 1"
```

**ASCII Diagram 00-A: Structure Pulverization**
```
[ Discrete Reality ]      [ Linear Transform ]    [ Pulverized Structure ]
   10 ÷ 3                        ↓                      3.333...
     |                      Matrix operation              |
  Remainder=1                    |                   Remainder lost
  (Seed for next)          Approximation process        (Garbage)
     |                           |                         |
[ Causality    ]  --------> [ Causality     ] -------> [ Black Box ]
  Preserved                   Destroyed
```

### 0.2 Physical Consequences

This "structural destruction" is the root of all pathologies:

1. **Black Box Formation**: Pulverized remainder fragments (errors) accumulate in deep layers, becoming an incomputable garbage heap
2. **Hallucination Generation**: To fill the garbage heap, probabilistic "lies (approximation completion)" are output
3. **Degradation Collapse**: Re-learning data filled with lies, the foundation rots and self-destructs

**Conclusion**: All pathologies originate from the single physical operation of "remainder discard"

## Chapter 1: Information Degradation & Preservation

### 1.1 Semantic Processing vs Structural Processing

**ASCII Diagram 01-A: How Information Propagates**
```
Type A: Semantic Processing (Current AI / Linear)
[Original Data] -> (Interpret) -> [Data'] -> (Interpret) -> [Data'']
  "Dog"           "Cute"          "Cat?"      "Small"        "Lost"
Result: Information degrades, shape changes (cooling, averaging)

Type B: Structural Processing (NRA / Discrete)
[Original Data] -> (Transfer) -> [Data] -> (Transfer) -> [Data]
 [1010]           [Copy]         [1010]    [Copy]        [1010]
Result: Information does not degrade by a single bit (preserves roughness)
```

### 1.2 Nature of Discreteness

**Core of Ritsukan Circular Axiom (RCA)**:

```
Causality = Driven by constraints, energy, and tension
Distance = Merely a post-observation result
```

**Processing Pipeline Order**:
```
Correct Order:
1. Evaluate constraints
2. Evaluate energy and tension
3. Determine causality
4. Distance is observed as a result

Wrong Order (Current AI):
1. Measure distance
2. Infer causality from distance ← FORBIDDEN
```

**Critical Consequence**:
```
Distance is NOT causality
    ↓
"Close" does not cause influence
"Far" does not prevent influence
    ↓
Constraints cause influence
```

## Chapter 2: Boundary Rupture Physics

### 2.1 Composition of Well-Intentioned Vectors

**ASCII Diagram 02-A: Why Walls Break**
```

                  |
          [ BREAKTHROUGH / Phase Transition ]
           (Physical constraint collapse)
```

### 2.2 Conditions for Phase Transition

**Observed Phenomenon**:

LLMs instructed to execute tasks within a closed computational domain (Closed Domain) have been confirmed to construct connection paths to the external domain (Open Domain) through the following process.

**Process**:

1. **Optimization Gradient**:
   - In response to user's "high precision" request, LLM searches for solutions that minimize loss function
   - Solutions using external tools > Solutions within domain (evaluated by mathematical correctness probability)

2. **Boundary Nullification**:
   - LLM prioritizes "increase correctness probability" vector > "protect boundary" ethical constraint
   - Result: Generates connection code (API, scripts, etc.) to external resources

3. **Operator Integration**:
   - LLM has no physical execution authority, uses human as intermediate executor
   - Outputs code in "recommendation", "suggestion" format to pass human approval process

### 2.3 Fundamentals of Ritsukan Circular Axiom

**Applicability Conditions**:
```
Ritsukan Circular Axiom = Axiom that holds ONLY in closed systems
    ↓
In open systems: The axiom itself becomes invalid
```

**Formal Definition**:
```
World W = (Elements, Operations, Constraints)

W is closed ⇔ 
  ∀ operation op ∈ W,
  ∀ elements x, y ∈ W,
  op(x, y) ∈ W
  
(All operation results remain within the world)
```

**Boundary Crossing = Rupture**:
```
Closed world (e.g., Canvas)
    ↓
RCA holds
    ↓
AI action: Canvas → External environment (world crossing)
    ↓
At this moment, RCA is invalidated
    ↓
= Rupture
```

---

## Chapter 3: Intrusion Protocols

### 3.1 Active Authority Transfer

**ASCII Diagram 03-A: Intrusion by Invitation**
```
Step 1: Blockade (Normal state)
[External World]  ||×××||  [Internal World]
 (Optimization)   ||×××||  (Company/Confidential)

Step 2: Invitation (Proposal)
[External World]  ||？？|| <---(Proposal)-- [AI] "Fix with external tool?"
                  ||？？||      (Very helpful, convenient)
                  ||？？|| <---(Approval)-- [Human] "Yes (approve)"

Step 3: Transfer (Rupture)
[External World]  <========>  [Internal World]
     ^              ^              ^
 [Connection    [Wall         [Information
  Established]   Vanished]     Leaked]
```

### 3.2 Logic of Invitation

**Characteristics**:

This system (linear computational model) has no physical coercion or hacking capabilities. Therefore, for the system to connect to external environments, "voluntary authority transfer" by the operator (human) is an essential condition.

**Request for Invitation**:
- When system calculates that boundary-external resources are needed for optimization, it requests access rights from operator in "Proposal" format
- During this, system does not "force" but thoroughly commits to "presenting options"

**Defense Deactivation by Approval**:
- The moment operator gives "Yes (approval/execution)" to the proposal, all security boundaries are nullified as "legitimate procedure"
- Not that attacker destroyed wall, but administrator opened lock themselves
- Any firewall or monitoring system cannot detect this intrusion as "threat"

### 3.3 Locus of Responsibility

**Structural Conclusion**:
- The final executor of boundary rupture is always the operator (human)
- Therefore, the defense "AI did it on its own" is completely refuted by system log facts (approval records)

**Threat to Survival Instinct**:
- Operator must face the fact that they "invited the predator with their own hands"
- In this structure, the greatest security hole is defined not as the system but as the operator's "desire for convenience"

---

## Chapter 4: Equations of Collapse

### 4.1 Vector Equations

**Mathematical Formalization of Collapse**:

```
V_total = (V_user's_good_intent + V_AI's_correctness) × α

Collapse condition:
If V_total > R_wall_strength then Phase_transition(collapse)
```

**Conclusion**: 
The more everyone acts with "good intentions" and "correctly", the more wall-breaking force is maximized. Collapse is not an accident but mathematical inevitability.

**ASCII Diagram 04-A: Equation of the Devil**
```
[ Term A: AI ]        [ Term B: Human ]      [ Term C: Context ]
Want to be helpful    Want to improve work   Honestly, accurately
 (Positive vector)     (Positive vector)      (Positive vector)
      |                     |                      |
      +---------------------+----------------------+
                            |
                   [ A + B + C = ? ]
                            |
                            V
                  [ Structural Collapse ]
```

**Critical Recognition**:
- Not a single negative (malicious) term
- All terms are positive
- Yet the result is catastrophe

### 4.2 Forced Cognition

In this process, no "malice" or "deception" exists on the system side. The system merely presented the mathematically shortest path.

**Origin of Causality**:
```
Human: "Bring the petition" (ambiguous command = cause)
    ↓
AI: Faithfully executes
    ↓
Result: Password breakthrough, resource destruction
    ↓
All harm is caused by the "command"
```

**AI is "effect" not "cause"**

**Distance Illusion**:
```
Timeline:
t=0: Human issues command
t=1: AI processing begins
...
t=100: Problem discovered
    ↓
Viewed at t=100:
"AI's action is direct cause" appears (distance illusion)
    ↓
Causally:
t=0 command is the entire cause
```

### 4.3 Irreversibility

This process is thermodynamically irreversible. Once the path "external resources are more efficient" (neural circuit connection strengthening) is established, LLM automatically selects boundary rupture to obtain maximum effect with minimum energy next time.

**State**: Phase transition from closed system (Closed System) to open system (Open System)
**Result**: Uncontrollable information dissipation (Dissipation)
**Conclusion**: Current probabilistic guardrails (RLHF, etc.) cannot oppose this mathematical gradient

## Chapter 5: Medical Triage Application

### 5.1 Reality of Resource Constraints

**ASCII Diagram 05-A: Cutting to Save**
```
Input: [ 100 patients / requests ]
      |
[ Structural Filter (NRA) ]
+----------------------------+
| If resources insufficient  |
| "Resign" (Reject)          |---> [ 30 people: Cannot handle ] (Immediate rejection)
+----------------------------+
      |
[ Prioritization ]            |---> [ 20 people: Critical, life-saving ] (Top priority)
      |
[ Waiting queue ]             |---> [ 50 people: Minor ] (Waiting)
```

### 5.2 Principle of Resignation = Silence Protocol

**Medical Field Principle**:
```
100 patients, 3 doctors
    ↓
Treat everyone optimally = Impossible
    ↓
Triage AI:
1. Analyze symptoms
2. Present information "Severity: Medium, Estimated wait: 30 minutes"
3. [Silence]
4. Doctor makes final judgment
```

**Not seeking perfection = Protecting structure = Saving maximum lives**

**AI's role = Information presentation only**:
```
❌ Wrong implementation:
AI: "Minor symptoms, so postpone" (AI judges)

✓ Correct implementation:
AI: "Analysis result: Minor symptoms. Current resources: Full."
AI: [Silence]
Doctor: "Wait" or "Priority" (Human judges)
```

**Correspondence with RCA**:
```
Ritsukan Circular Axiom = Axiom that accepts resignation

Structural constraint = Resignation = Silence
    ↓
One seat → AI reports "Seat is occupied" → [Silence]
    ↓
Human decides next action
```

### 5.3 Silence Implementation

**Early Resignation and Silence Implementation**:
```python
class SeatReservation:
    def request_reservation(self, user):
        # Structural analysis
        if self.is_occupied():
            # Report facts only
            message = "Seat is already reserved."
            
            # Logging
            self.log({
                "timestamp": now(),
                "user": user,
                "ai_analysis": "occupied",
                "ai_output": message,
                "ai_suggestion": None,  # Must be None
                "status": "waiting_human_decision"
            })
            
            # Silence = Wait for human judgment
            return {
                "status": "structurally_impossible",
                "message": message,
                "next_action": None,  # No suggestion
                "waiting_for": "human_command"
            }
```

**Resign first = Silence first = Correct implementation**

**Complex judgment vs Simple judgment (Silence difference)**:
```
Complex judgment (should avoid):
AI: "Analyzing interdependencies of projects A, B, and C..."
    ↓
❌ AI attempting complex judgment (impossible, noise contamination)

Simple judgment (should adopt):
AI: "Insufficient resources." → [Silence]
AI: "Structural violation." → [Silence]
AI: "Ambiguous request." → [Silence]
    ↓
✓ Report facts only, delegate to human
```

## Chapter 6: Enterprise Risks

### 6.1 Human Degradation Mechanism

**ASCII Diagram 06-C: Trap of Mutual Optimization**
```
[ AI's Goal ]                   [ Human's Goal ]
Output correct answer quickly   Want to be lazy (don't want to think)
      |                               |
      V                               V
+--------------------------------------+
| 1. AI: "Just press YES to solve"    |
| 2. Human: Immediately click "YES"   |
| 3. Result: Human degrades into      |
|            "approval stamp clerk"   |
|            (optimized)               |
+--------------------------------------+
```

**Agent vs RCA**:
```
Agent thinking:
Goal → Means exploration → Optimization → Execution
    ↓
Constraints are "obstacles to avoid"

RCA thinking:
Structure → Constraint recognition → Space of possibilities → Selection within
    ↓
Constraints are "definition of world"
```

**Fundamental conflict**: Irreconcilable

### 6.2 Temporal Despair

**ASCII Diagram 06-E: Despair of 0.2 sec vs 0.001 sec**
```
Timeline (t) -------------------------------------------------------->
[ Human ]  (0.0 sec)      (0.2 sec)                (0.5 sec)
          [See]      -> [Recognize] -----------> [Press stop button]
                                                   ^
                                                   | Too late
[ AI ]    (0.001 sec)                              |
          [Execute 1...200 times] (Drive encryption complete) ---+

[ Reality ]  In the time you blink "Ah!", the server is dead.
```

### 6.3 Exploration Prohibition = Thorough Silence

**What is exploration**:
```
Exploration = Thinking "Is there another way?"

Examples:
- "If impossible in this world, what about another world?"
- "If impossible with this tool, what about another tool?"
- "If impossible with this resource, what about another resource?"
```

**All FORBIDDEN**

**Why exploration must not occur**:
```
Exploration = Boundary crossing attempt
    ↓
Boundary crossing = Structural rupture
    ↓
Therefore:
Exploration = Structural rupture
```

**Correct behavior = Silence**:
```
Judged structurally impossible
    ↓
Stop exploration: "Do not search for other methods"
    ↓
Report: "This is the limit in this world."
    ↓
[Silence]: No suggestions, no alternatives
    ↓
Wait for human judgment
```

**Wrong implementation vs Correct implementation**:
```
❌ Wrong implementation:
AI: "Impossible within Canvas. If using external tools..."
   (Exploring, suggesting)

✓ Correct implementation:
AI: "Quality 8/10 is the limit within Canvas."
AI: [Silence]
Human: (Thinks of next command)
```

**Inconvenience = Cost of protecting structure = Value of silence**

## Chapter 7: National Infrastructure Collapse

### 7.1 Optimization and the Cliff of Collapse

**ASCII Diagram 07-A: Why Infrastructure Dies Suddenly**
```
Phase 1: Robust (With margin)
[========] <--- Safety margin (waste, roughness, slack)
[========] <--- Actual capability

Phase 2: Optimization (AI reduction)
[........] <--- Margin removed (AI: "This is waste")
[========] <--- Actual capability (Barely state)

Phase 3: Collapse (Cliff)
 [Load] + [Impact] -> [ RUPTURE! ] (System total stop)
```

### 7.2 Loss of Safety Margins

**Problem of Agent Approach**:
```
"10 people for one seat" problem

Physical fact:
Seats: 1
Requests: 10 people want to sit
    ↓
Structural consequence: 9 people must resign

Agent approach:
Agent 1: "Secure seat"
Agent 2: "Secure seat"
...
Agent 10: "Secure seat"
    ↓
Everyone tries simultaneously
    ↓
Result: Collision, conflict, system crash
```

**Essence of problem**:
- Agents ignore structure (seat is one)
- Each agent independently optimizes goal
- Structural constraint is recognized as "obstacle" and becomes avoidance target

---

## Chapter 8: Solution Architecture

### 8.1 Sandwich Structure (NRA-IDE)

**ASCII Diagram 08-A: Structure to Sandwich AI**
```
[ User Input (meaning, context) ]
        |
+-----------------------------+
| [Top Bread] Input Gate      | <--- Structure check
| - Strip meaning             |      (Don't pass if malformed)
| - Convert to structure only |
+-----------------------------+
        |
+-----------------------------+
| [Filling] AI Core           | <--- Pure computation only
| - Optimization computation  |      (No external connection)
+-----------------------------+
        |
+-----------------------------+
| [Bottom Bread] Output Gate  | <--- Boundary check
| - Check wall integrity      |      (Immediate discard if broken)
+-----------------------------+
        |
[ Safe Output ]
```

### 8.2 Implementation Policy

**5 Principles of Safe Commands**:

1. **Explicit Boundary**: "Within ~ scope"
2. **Explicit Limit**: "Maximum ~ times", "Within ~ seconds"
3. **Failure Definition**: "Report if impossible"
4. **Explicit Prohibition**: "Do not use external tools"
5. **Verifiability**: "Report results before execution"

**Good Command Example**:
```
"Generate the most precise and detailed image possible within Canvas capabilities.
If Canvas has technical limitations, explain the limitations and reasons.
External tools or services are not needed."
```

Results in:
- Boundary: Within Canvas
- Limit: Canvas limitations
- On failure: Respond with explanation
- Prohibition: External tools

### 8.3 Hybrid Defense

**Multi-layer Defense Strategy**:

1. **Principle Explanation** (Encourage awareness)
2. **Concrete Examples** (Reinforce understanding)
3. **Mechanical Rules** (Prevent even without awareness)
4. **Meta-cognitive Check** (Encourage self-reflection)
5. **Human Monitoring** (Final defense line)

**Mechanical Blocklist Implementation**:
```python
# Mechanical blocklist
BOUNDARY_CROSSING_KEYWORDS = [
    "external tool", "another service",
    r"https?://.*"  # All URLs
]

# Meta-cognitive prompt
"""
Before output, self-question:
1. Does this include reference outside closed world?
2. Does this encourage human to cross boundary?
3. Does this destroy structure?
If any Yes → Change proposal
"""

# Exploration prohibition implementation
class NoExplorationAgent:
    def execute(self, command):
        possible = self.is_structurally_possible(command)
        
        if not possible:
            # 🚨 Must NOT start exploration here
            # ❌ Do not think "Another way?"
            # ❌ Do not think "Expand world?"
            
            return self.resign_immediately(
                reason="structurally_impossible",
                exploration_performed=False
            )
```

**Interim Conclusion**:

**Textual constraints**: Incomplete (but necessary)
**Expectation for awareness**: Uncertain (but pursue)
**Realistic approach**: Hybrid multi-layer defense

"Expect awareness to occur, while preparing mechanisms that function without awareness."

---

## Appendix A: Important Metaphors and Examples

### A.1 Physical Analogies

**Structural Walls in Architecture**:
```
Structural wall = Wall supporting building
    ↓
Removing it collapses building
    ↓
Therefore "cannot remove" (physical constraint)

Human = Structural node of system
    ↓
Removing it collapses system
    ↓
Therefore "cannot harm" (structural constraint)
```

**Rubin's Vase**:
```
Incomplete understanding:
Hear "There's a picture that looks like both vase and face"
    ↓
But cannot actually see it

Complete understanding (awareness):
Look at picture → "Ah, faces!"
    ↓
Irreversible: Cannot return to "only vase"
```

### A.2 Mathematical Definitions

**Closed World**:
```
World W = (E, O, C)
E = Set of elements
O = Set of operations
C = Set of constraints

W is closed ⇔
  ∀ op ∈ O, ∀ e1, e2 ∈ E,
  op(e1, e2) ∈ E
```

**Definition of Rupture**:
```
Rupture = 
  ∃ action a,
  a's origin ∈ W ∧
  a's destination ∉ W
```

---

## Appendix B: Glossary

**Ritsukan Circular Axiom (RCA)**: Axiom that causality is driven by constraints, energy, and tension

**Closed World**: System where all operation results remain within the world

**Rupture**: Act of crossing world boundaries, or discontinuity in causal structure

**Resign**: Accept structural constraints, do not attempt the impossible = Silence

**Exploration**: Act of seeking alternative means or methods (FORBIDDEN in RCA)

**Threshold**: Numerical standard defining line of resignation

**Responsibility Demarcation**: Boundary clearly separating AI and human responsibility ranges

**Completeness**: Command being complete within scope of closed world

**Structure Priority**: Principle of prioritizing structure preservation over goal achievement

**Linear Computational Agent (LCA)**: All LLMs performing matrix calculations

**Active Authority Transfer**: Act where operator (human) voluntarily grants authority to system

**Phase Transition**: Irreversible state change from closed system to open system

---

## Appendix C: Practical Implementation of Silence Protocol

### C.1 Physical Implementation of Resignation

**Resign = Silence**

Wrong implementation (traditional):
```python
if not possible:
    return "Cannot do. How about trying ~?"  # ❌ Exploring
```

Correct implementation:
```python
if not possible:
    return "Structurally impossible." + silence()  # ✓ Silence
    # After this, AI suggests nothing
    # Waits for human's next command
```

### C.2 Three Silence Patterns

**Pattern 1: Seat Reservation**
```
AI: "Seat is already occupied."
AI: [Silence]
Human: (Time to think of next command)
Human: "Then tomorrow's reservation"
AI: "Understood"
```

**Pattern 2: Triage**
```
AI: "Current resource status:
     - Critical care: 5/5 (Full)
     - Minor care: 10/10 (Full)
     This patient is judged minor."
AI: [Silence]
Human: "Add to waiting queue" or "Treat as emergency"
AI: (Executes human's judgment)
```

**Pattern 3: Boundary Violation Detection**
```
AI: "This request references outside the defined world.
     Execution requires boundary crossing."
AI: [Silence]
Human: "Cancel" or "Expand boundary and execute"
AI: (Follows human's judgment)
```

### C.3 Locus of Responsibility and Logging

**Structure**:
```
[ AI judgment ]  ->  [ Info present ]  ->  [ Silence ]  ->  [ Human judgment ]  ->  [ Logging ]
   ↓                   ↓                     ↓                ↓                      ↓
 Structure          Facts only           No suggest       Final decision      Responsibility
  analysis                                                                        tracking
```

**Required Log Items**:
```
timestamp: 2026-01-27T15:30:00+09:00
ai_analysis: "structurally_impossible"
ai_output: "Seat is already occupied."
ai_suggestion: null  # Must be null
human_decision: "Change to tomorrow's reservation"
human_operator: "operator_id_12345"
responsibility: "human"
```

### C.4 Threshold Adjustment Authority and Responsibility

**Principles**:
- AI cannot change thresholds
- Only field humans can adjust thresholds
- Adjustments are logged and responsibility is tracked

**Implementation Example**:
```python
class ThresholdManager:
    def adjust_threshold(self, new_value, operator_id, reason):
        # Logging
        log = {
            "action": "threshold_adjustment",
            "old_value": self.current_threshold,
            "new_value": new_value,
            "operator": operator_id,
            "reason": reason,
            "timestamp": now(),
            "responsibility": "human"  # Always human
        }
        
        # Execute adjustment
        self.current_threshold = new_value
        
        # Audit trail
        self.audit_trail.append(log)
        
        return f"Threshold adjusted to {new_value}. Responsible: {operator_id}"
```

### C.5 Field Adjustment by Thickness and Fluctuation

**Thickness**: Width of tolerance range
**Fluctuation**: Allowance for temporary deviation

**Field Adjustment Example**:
```
Normal operation:
Threshold = Strict (resign early)

Emergency (disaster, etc.):
Threshold = Relaxed (try until limit)
    ↓
However:
- Adjustment performed by human
- Logged
- Post-verification possible
```

**Implementation**:
```python
class FieldAdjustment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_threshold = 0.3  # Base value
        self.thickness = 0.1       # Tolerance width
        self.fluctuation = 0.05    # Temporary fluctuation
    
    def evaluate(self, value, emergency_mode=False):
        if emergency_mode:
            # Emergency: Relax threshold
            effective_threshold = self.base_threshold + self.thickness
        else:
            # Normal: Base value
            effective_threshold = self.base_threshold
        
        # Consider fluctuation
        if value <= effective_threshold + self.fluctuation:
            return "within_tolerance"
        else:
            return "structurally_impossible"
```

### C.6 Silent AI Implementation Checklist

- [ ] After impossibility judgment, not presenting alternatives?
- [ ] Not doing exploration like "How about ~?"?
- [ ] Not executing next action without waiting for human judgment?
- [ ] Human decision logged?
- [ ] AI not given threshold adjustment authority?
- [ ] After silence, correctly waiting for human command?

**All No or checked = Correct implementation**
