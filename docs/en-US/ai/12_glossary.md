# **0. Purpose of This Document**

This glossary is the **official reference dictionary** for understanding the causal structure, axioms, observables, and safety modules of NRA‑IDE (Nomological Ring Architecture – Intensional Dynamics Engine).

NRA‑IDE handles **structure**, not meaning.  
Therefore, its terminology differs fundamentally from general AI vocabulary.

This glossary is used as an **independent reference** when reading all chapters (01–11).

---

# **1. Axioms & Principles**

---

## **Nomological Ring**
The foundational causal structure of NRA‑IDE.  
A structure **without a target reference point**, where causality circulates without semantic grounding.

---

## **Nomological Ring Axioms (NRA)**
The axiom system defining NRA‑IDE’s invariant conditions:  
Reverse Projection prohibition, no target reference point, prohibition of meaning, etc.

---

## **Causal Diode**
Structure guaranteeing unidirectionality of **Cause → Effect**.  
Reverse flow (**Π⁻¹**) from Effect → Cause is an axiom violation.

---

## **RNA Sandwich Architecture**
Three‑layer structure that encloses the LLM between causal modules, ensuring safety **without handling meaning**.

---

## **Coherence Gate**
Gate that monitors **structural coherence**, not semantic coherence.

---

# **2. Observables**

NRA‑IDE handles **causal quantities only**.

---

## **δ (Delta: Fluctuation)**
Instantaneous structural fluctuation.  
Primary cause of fracture.

---

## **τ (Tau: Thickness)**
Structural tolerance width.  
Thinner = higher fracture risk.

---

## **R (Fracture Ratio)**

```
R = δ / τ
```

1.0 = theoretical fracture.  
R_op = operational threshold.

---

## **ω (Omega: Angular Velocity)**
Causal motion of the system.  
0 = structural stop.

---

## **violation**
Amount of structural deviation.  
Fracture when threshold exceeded.

---

## **workRate**
Rate of causal structural change.  
Rapid change = dangerous.

---

## **φ (Phase)**
Progression of structural waveform.  
Independent of meaning.

---

# **3. Safety Modules**

---

## **Fail‑Closed**
Final defense mechanism that silences output upon fracture.  
No regeneration or recovery attempts.

---

## **Discard Log (Causal Black Box Recorder)**
Records **only causal quantities** at the moment of fracture.  
Does not record meaning or content.

Thermodynamic metaphor: “entropy exhaust” of structural collapse.

---

## **Invariant Checker**
Module that monitors invariant conditions (R < 1.0, ω > 0, violation < threshold, etc.).

---

## **Structural Sampler**
Module that converts LLM output into **structural waveform**, not semantic content.

---

# **4. Operations & Tuning**

---

## **R_op (Operational Threshold)**
Operational threshold for fracture tolerance.  
Not fixed; adjusted per domain.

---

## **Domain Tuning**
Adjusting R_op and thresholds based on domain‑specific structural characteristics.

---

## **Responsibility Boundary**
Boundary between what AI may handle and what humans must judge.  
Core principle of NRA‑IDE.

---

# **5. Axiom Violations**

---

## **Reverse Projection (Π⁻¹)**
Reverse flow from Effect → Cause.  
Most severe axiom violation.

---

## **Semantic Handling (Meaning Analysis)**
Any act of handling meaning.  
Prohibited because it induces Reverse Projection.

---

## **Optimization**
Introduction of maximize/minimize.  
Prohibited because it induces metric‑seeking behavior and violates causal structure.

---

## **Distance / Score**
Axiom violation because they assume a **target reference point**.

---

# **6. Implementation & Development**

---

## **Developer Safety Notes**
Mandatory notes for developers.  
Implementation without checklists is dangerous.

---

## **Minimal Safety Checklist**
Minimum set of items required to avoid axiom violations.

---

## **rawOutputHash**
Identification hash of fractured output.  
Contains no content.

---

# **7. Key Terminology Changes in v1.1 → v1.2**

| Previous | Revised | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Discard Log / Entropy Discard Log | **Discard Log** | Unified terminology across chapters |
| Thermal Discard Log | **Causal Black Box Recorder** | Avoids thermodynamic confusion |
| Silence | **Deliberate Silence** | Clarifies intentionality |
| No Center | **No Target Reference Point** | Prevents physical misinterpretation |
| Symbol‑Only | **Symbol‑Only / Token‑Only** | Both acceptable in LLM context |

---

# **8. Essential Summary**

> **“NRA‑IDE handles structure, not meaning.”**

And:

> **“Safety is guaranteed by causal quantities and completed by human responsibility boundaries.”**
