# **0. Purpose of This Chapter**

NRA‑IDE provides **causal‑structure‑based safety**, transcending the limitations of semantic‑based LLM safety.

However, NRA‑IDE is not omnipotent.  
It has **applicable domains, structural limitations, and operational constraints**.

This chapter clarifies:

- **Benefits of NRA‑IDE (what it can do)**  
- **Limitations of NRA‑IDE (what it cannot do)**  
- **Boundaries of applicable domains**  
- **Human responsibility boundaries**  

to prevent misuse caused by misunderstanding or excessive expectations.

---

# **1. Benefits of NRA‑IDE**

The benefits of NRA‑IDE lie in **structural, causal safety guarantees** that conventional semantic‑based safety could never achieve.

---

## **1.1 Safety Independent of Meaning**

Because NRA‑IDE does not handle meaning:

- No context‑dependent misjudgment  
- No ambiguity in ethical judgment  
- Detects **structural danger**, not **content danger**  

This is fundamentally different from conventional LLM safety.

---

## **1.2 Can Detect Structural Fracture**

Using observables (δ, τ, R, ω, violation), NRA‑IDE can detect:

- Output fluctuation  
- Structural thinning  
- Angular velocity decrease  
- Deviation accumulation  

These reveal **precursors to structural fracture**.

---

## **1.3 Safe Stop via Fail‑Closed**

On fracture:

- Output stops  
- Deliberate Silence is returned  
- No regeneration  
- No recovery attempts  

A **structurally guaranteed safe stop** is achieved.

---

## **1.4 Structural Visualization via Discard Log**

By recording causal quantities at fracture:

- Cause of fracture  
- Fracture pattern  
- Validity of threshold configuration  
- Domain‑specific structural characteristics  

can be analyzed **by structure, not meaning**.

---

## **1.5 Clarifies Human Responsibility Boundary**

NRA‑IDE is not a structure to strengthen AI.  
It is a structure to **clarify human responsibility boundaries**.

- Where AI fractured  
- Where human judgment must intervene  

becomes explicit.

---

## **1.6 Improved Safety in High‑Risk Domains**

NRA‑IDE is particularly effective in domains with **extremely high error cost**:

- Medical  
- Aviation  
- Nuclear  
- Finance  
- Autonomous driving  
- Legal review  

---

# **2. Limitations of NRA‑IDE**

NRA‑IDE is powerful but not omnipotent.  
The following are **structurally unavoidable limitations**.

---

## **2.1 Cannot Handle Semantic Safety**

Because NRA‑IDE does not handle meaning:

- Content danger  
- Ethical judgment  
- Context appropriateness  
- Intent inference  

**must be handled by a separate semantic safety layer**.

---

## **2.2 Cannot Control LLM Internal State**

NRA‑IDE is an **external structure**.  
It does not modify LLM internals:

- Internal probability distribution  
- Internal representations  
- Internal semantic dynamics  

cannot be controlled.

---

## **2.3 Cannot Completely Prevent Fracture**

NRA‑IDE **detects fracture and stops**.  
It does not eliminate fracture entirely.

---

## **2.4 Operational Threshold (R_op) Is Site‑Dependent**

R_op is not fixed.  
It must be tuned according to **on‑site risk level**.

Incorrect configuration → fracture.

---

## **2.5 Human Review Is Mandatory**

NRA‑IDE presumes **human final judgment**.

- Implementation without checklists is dangerous  
- Axiom violations cannot be detected by LLM  
- Human responsibility boundary is essential  

---

## **2.6 Cannot Prevent All Forms of LLM Misuse**

NRA‑IDE provides **structural safety**, but:

- Semantic misuse  
- Social misuse  
- Intentional attacks  

require **separate countermeasures**.

---

# **3. Boundaries of Applicable Domains**

Domains where NRA‑IDE is particularly effective:

- Medical  
- Aviation  
- Nuclear  
- Finance  
- Autonomous driving  
- Legal review  
- High‑risk business support  

Domains where NRA‑IDE may be **unnecessarily strict**:

- Creative writing  
- Casual chat  
- Entertainment  
- Meaning‑centric tasks  

---

# **4. Essential Summary**

The essence of NRA‑IDE is:

> **“NRA‑IDE guarantees safety by structure, not meaning.”**

And:

> **“NRA‑IDE is not for strengthening AI, but for protecting human responsibility boundaries.”**
