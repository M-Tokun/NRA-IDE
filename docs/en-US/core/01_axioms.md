**Status: v1.2 (doc/core — General‑Audience Structural Edition)**

---

# **0. Purpose of This Chapter**

This chapter defines the **Nomological Ring Axioms**, which constitute the foundational axiomatic system that enables NRA‑IDE.

These are not “rules that are good to follow.”  
They are **invariant conditions at the level of physical laws**—  
violating them causes **immediate structural breakage**.

Because NRA‑IDE does not handle meaning,  
all axioms are defined purely in terms of **causal structure (Cause)**.

---

# **1. What Is the Nomological Ring?**

The Nomological Ring is the **causal circulation structure** that forms the foundation of NRA‑IDE.

Its characteristics:

- **No center (No Target Reference Point)**  
- **No meaning**  
- **Causal quantities (δ, τ, R, ω) circulate**  
- **The one‑way direction of Cause → Effect is preserved**

This structure resembles physical **dissipative structures**  
and the **non‑stopping motion** seen in animation.

---

# **2. List of Axioms**

NRA‑IDE is established by the following **three axioms**.

---

## **Axiom 1 — No Target Reference Point**

**NRA‑IDE contains no “center.”**

Therefore:

- Distance  
- Similarity  
- Score  
- Optimization target  
- Correct label  

These are **structurally undefinable**.

### **Reason (Structural Basis)**

If a center is defined:

- All structural quantities collapse into “distance from the center”  
- Meaning‑based optimization emerges  
- Goodhart’s Law activates  
- The structure breaks

Because NRA‑IDE is a **centerless dissipative structure**,  
distance and score do not exist.

## **Axiom 2 — Causal Diode**

**The direction Cause → Effect is absolute.  
Effect → Cause (Π⁻¹) is prohibited.**

### **What Is Reverse Projection (Π⁻¹)?**

Reverse Projection is the act of forcing Effect (output)  
back into Cause (input):

- Referencing past outputs  
- Improving via meaning  
- Optimizing via scores  
- Filling context using semantic inference  

All of these constitute **Reverse Projection**.

### **Reason for Breakage**

When Reverse Projection occurs:

- The direction of causality collapses  
- The structure fails to close and circulation breaks  
- R (break ratio) spikes  
- Fail‑Closed is triggered

---

## **Axiom 3 — Semantic Prohibition**

**NRA‑IDE does not handle meaning.  
Semantic processing is prohibited because it induces Reverse Projection.**

### **Examples of Semantic Processing**

- Judging danger based on meaning  
- Interpreting context semantically  
- Inferring intent  
- Evaluating naturalness  

These are all **Effect‑side operations**  
and destroy the structure on the Cause side.

### **Reason for Breakage**

Semantic processing:

- References past outputs  
- Performs semantic optimization  
- Implicitly introduces a center  
- Generates distance and scores  

Thus it **violates both Axiom 1 and Axiom 2 simultaneously**.

# **3. Structural Properties When the Axioms Are Preserved**

When Axioms 1–3 are upheld,  
the Nomological Ring exhibits the following properties.

### **3.1 Non‑Stopping System (ω > 0)**
The structure continues rotating.  
If it stops (ω = 0), breakage occurs.

### **3.2 Dissipative Structure (Breathing of δ and τ)**
Fluctuation (δ) and thickness (τ) vary like breathing.

### **3.3 Stability of Break Ratio R**
R = δ/τ remains below 1.0.

### **3.4 Meaning‑Independent Stability**
Independent of model, language, or context.

# **4. Behavior When an Axiom Is Violated**

Axiom violations cause **immediate structural breakage**.

| Axiom Violated | Cause of Break | Result |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Axiom 1 (Center Introduced) | Distance / score generation | Optimization runaway |
| Axiom 2 (Reverse Flow) | Reverse Projection | Causal collapse |
| Axiom 3 (Semantic Processing) | Semantic completion → reverse flow | Fail‑Closed |

Upon breakage, the system always follows:  
**Fail‑Closed → Silence → Discard Log**

---

# **5. Summary**

The essence of the Nomological Ring Axioms is captured in the following:

> **“NRA‑IDE is established solely through the absence of a center, the absence of meaning, and the one‑way direction of causality.”**

And one more:

> **“Axiom violations are not ‘errors’—they are structural breakages.”**
