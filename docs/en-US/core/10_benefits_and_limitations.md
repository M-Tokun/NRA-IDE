## **0. Introduction**

Unlike conventional AI safety techniques,  
NRA‑IDE is an engine that guarantees safety **without handling meaning, optimization, or history—only causal structure**.

This chapter clarifies what NRA‑IDE can **structurally provide (benefits)**  
and what it **structurally cannot provide (limitations)**,  
so that readers can correctly understand *what NRA‑IDE is and what it is not*.

# **1. Benefits of NRA‑IDE  
— Structural Summary of “What It Can Do”**

All benefits of NRA‑IDE converge on one point:  
**safety achieved by not handling meaning.**

### **1.1 Hallucinations are treated as structural fractures, not semantic errors**
Because evaluation is based on **R (δ/τ)** rather than meaning,  
hallucinations can be detected as **structural deviations**.

### **1.2 Model‑independent safety**
Since no semantic evaluation is performed,  
safety does not depend on LLM type, performance, or version.

### **1.3 Structural prevention of optimization runaway**
Because no center exists,  
distance, score, and similarity cannot be defined—  
making **optimization structurally impossible**.

### **1.4 Reliable stopping through Fail‑Closed**
When uncertain, the system becomes silent,  
eliminating the need to “fix” dangerous outputs.

### **1.5 Transparency through the Discard Log**
Only causal quantities immediately before fracture are recorded,  
enabling safety verification.

### **1.6 Domain adaptation through Domain Tuning**
By adjusting τ (thickness) and R_op (threshold),  
the system can match the safety requirements of each domain.

### **1.7 Preservation of human responsibility boundaries**
NRA‑IDE does not replace judgment.  
Humans make the final decision, keeping responsibility clear.

# **2. Limitations of NRA‑IDE  
— Structural Summary of “What It Cannot Do”**

The limitations of NRA‑IDE are the direct consequence of  
its design principle: **no meaning, no optimization, no history**.

### **2.1 Does not guarantee semantic correctness**
The “meaning accuracy” of outputs cannot be guaranteed.

### **2.2 Does not perform quality improvement or optimization**
Improvement and optimization lie outside the structure.

### **2.3 Does not make autonomous judgments**
NRA‑IDE is a **safety engine**, not a judgment engine.

### **2.4 Does not guarantee naturalness of output**
Naturalness is semantic evaluation and therefore out of scope.

### **2.5 Cannot reference past outputs**
Because history is not handled,  
consistency and continuity cannot be guaranteed.

### **2.6 Cannot handle scores, distances, or similarity**
With no center, these concepts are structurally undefinable.

### **2.7 Cannot run improvement cycles (PDCA)**
Improvement induces optimization and is therefore outside the structure.

# **3. Important Note on Use‑Cases**

NRA‑IDE is **not a use‑case engine; it is a safety engine**.  
Therefore, this chapter does not describe  
“where it is useful” or “where it can be applied.”

Reasons:

- Humans easily misunderstand based on “this seems useful”  
- Listing industries leads to the illusion that “it works everywhere”  
- Encourages the myth of AI as a universal solution  
- NRA‑IDE’s essence lies in **structural safety**, not application  

Use‑cases are **left to the operator’s judgment**.

# **4. Essence**

> **“NRA‑IDE is not universal.  
>  But by clearly defining what it cannot do,  
>  it achieves the purest form of safety in the world.”**

# **Glossary**

## **calculated reconstruction（計算的再構成）**

A method that reconstructs structure **not through meaning**,  
but through **causal quantities (δ, τ, R)**,  
using calculation rather than inference.

- Does not handle expression  
- Not subject to copyright  
- Not imitation  
- Not guesswork  
- Performs only extraction and reconstruction of structure
