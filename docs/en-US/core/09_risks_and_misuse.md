## **0. Introduction**

The greatest risk in NRA‑IDE is **not the AI, but the human**.  
This chapter does not address structural rules or prohibitions,  
but focuses solely on **how humans misunderstand and misuse the system**—  
that is, their *behavioral patterns*.

Specific prohibitions are consolidated in **warning_note.md**,  
and therefore are not discussed here.

# **1. Misuse Driven by Human Cognitive Biases**

Humans naturally exhibit the following tendencies,  
which make NRA‑IDE easy to misuse.

### **1.1 Jumping to Meaning**
Humans instinctively “read meaning.”  
NRA‑IDE does not handle meaning,  
but humans “fill in meaning” automatically.

### **1.2 Judging by Similarity**
Humans judge based on “how similar something feels.”  
This impression‑based judgment causes misuse  
because NRA‑IDE evaluates structure, not similarity.

### **1.3 Referencing the Past**
Humans want to know “what happened last time.”  
This comes from natural memory structures.

### **1.4 Wanting to Improve**
The desire to “make it better,”  
though well‑intentioned,  
pushes the system toward structural damage.

### **1.5 Wanting to Optimize**
Humans seek “better states,”  
and this instinct becomes the root of misuse.

# **2. Misuse Patterns Common Among Developers**

Technical habits often conflict with NRA‑IDE.

### **2.1 “We should increase accuracy.”**
Improvement and optimization arise automatically.

### **2.2 “Let’s use the logs for training.”**
Developers are accustomed to using logs for improvement.

### **2.3 “Referencing past outputs will stabilize it.”**
Developers want to use history for stabilization.

### **2.4 “Wouldn’t distance metrics be useful?”**
Distance and scoring are familiar tools for engineers.

### **2.5 “Make it more natural.”**
“Naturalness” is mistakenly equated with semantic evaluation.

# **3. Misuse Patterns Common in Organizations**

Sometimes it is not individuals,  
but organizational culture that conflicts with NRA‑IDE.

### **3.1 Setting KPIs**
KPIs induce scoring behavior.

### **3.2 Running improvement cycles**
Organizations expect PDCA,  
but NRA‑IDE is not built on improvement.

### **3.3 “Can’t we make it more efficient?”**
Efficiency is simply another form of optimization.

### **3.4 “Let’s compare with last time.”**
Comparison culture triggers misuse.

# **4. Psychological Reasons Behind Misuse**

Misuse does not arise from malice—  
it arises naturally from **human psychological structure**.

### **4.1 Humans understand the world through meaning**
Not reading meaning is unnatural.

### **4.2 Humans seek improvement**
The desire to “make it better” is instinctive.

### **4.3 Humans judge by distance**
Spatial cognition is built on distance.

### **4.4 Humans reference the past**
Comparison and memory are basic human functions.

### **4.5 Humans assume a “center”**
A structure without a center feels counterintuitive.

# **5. Structural Measures to Prevent Misuse (Overview Only)**

Details are covered in other chapters,  
but the structures that prevent misuse include:

- **warning_note.md** (canonical list of prohibitions)  
- **checksheet.md** (implementation verification)  
- **Symbol‑Only Principle** (exclusion of meaning)  
- **Fail‑Closed** (irreversible shutdown)  
- **Isolation of the Discard Log**  
- **Role separation across chapters 00–12**  

This chapter does not describe these structures in detail.

# **6. Essence**

The essence of this chapter is captured in one sentence:

> **“The greatest risk is not the AI, but the human’s natural habits.”**
