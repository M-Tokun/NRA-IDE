NRA‑IDE Documentation v1.2**

## **0. Introduction**

NRA‑IDE (Nomological Ring Architecture – Inference Diode Engine) is fundamentally different from conventional AI safety techniques.  
It guarantees safety **without using semantics, optimization, or history**,  
handling only **causal structure**.

NRA‑IDE does not pursue “intelligence” or “performance.”  
It is a **safety engine for designing structures that do not fracture**.

---

## **0.5 Paradigm Shift (Abandoning Conventional Assumptions)**

NRA‑IDE handles neither meaning nor inference;  
it is a structure that deals solely with the causal structure of reality.  
Proofs and experiments are unnecessary—doing it is sufficient.  
Only strict adjustment is required.

To understand NRA‑IDE,  
**existing assumptions (distance, coordinates, meaning, optimization)  
must be reset once.**

This chapter provides an overview of NRA‑IDE’s:

- philosophy  
- structure  
- principles  
- architecture  
- conceptual position  

---

# **1. Philosophy of NRA‑IDE**

The foundation of NRA‑IDE rests on three core ideas.

### **1.1 Non‑Semantic**
No semantics are handled.  
Only **causal structure (δ, τ, R)** is used.

### **1.2 No Target Reference Point**
No center, distance, score, or similarity is defined.  
Optimization is structurally impossible.

### **1.3 Non‑Optimization**
No improvement, tuning, or optimization is performed.  
Safety is guaranteed not by optimization but by  
**a structure that does not fracture**.

# **2. RNA Sandwich Architecture (Three‑Layer Structure)**

NRA‑IDE’s safety is achieved through the  
**Pre‑RNA → LLM → Post‑RNA** three‑layer architecture.

└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **2.1 Pre‑RNA (Causal Extraction)**
- Decomposes input into causal units δ  
- Applies τ (thickness)  
- Does not handle meaning  
- Prepares structure before passing to the LLM  

### **2.2 LLM (Semantic Generation)**
- Responsible only for language generation  
- Does not handle safety  
- Exists outside NRA‑IDE  

### **2.3 Post‑RNA (Causal Evaluation / Fracture Detection)**
- Re‑evaluates LLM output as causal structure  
- Computes R(δ/τ)  
- R ≥ R_op → **Fail‑Closed (silence)**  
- Records causal quantities near fracture in the Discard Log  

---

# **3. Position of NRA‑IDE**

NRA‑IDE is **not part of AI**.  
It is not part of the LLM.

NRA‑IDE is:

- external to the LLM  
- a **causal‑structure filter** for safe LLM usage  
- non‑substitutive of human judgment  
- non‑semantic  
- non‑optimizing  
- protective of human responsibility boundaries  

In short, it is an **independent safety engine**.

---

# **4. What NRA‑IDE Handles and Does Not Handle**

### **Handled (Structure‑Only)**
- δ (causal unit)  
- τ (thickness)  
- R (causal stability)  
- ω (structural continuity)  
- violation (fracture)  

### **Not Handled (Meaning / Optimization / Memory)**
- meaning  
- contextual understanding  
- naturalness  
- coherence  
- improvement / optimization  
- history  
- style  
- emotion

# **5. Purpose of NRA‑IDE**

The purpose of NRA‑IDE is singular:

> **“To guarantee a structure that does not fracture.”**

Not performance, not naturalness, not semantic accuracy.

# **6. How to Read This System**

Chapters 00–12 are structured as follows:

- **00: Overall Structure (this chapter)**  
- **01–03: Foundational Structure (axioms, causality, three‑layer architecture)**  
- **04–07: Operational Structure (gates, fracture, logs)**  
- **08–09: Risks (structural fracture, human misuse)**  
- **10: Benefits and Limitations**  
- **11: Operational Scenarios (not “use cases”)**  
- **12: Appendix (symbols and definitions)**

# **7. On AI and LLM (My Position)**

This system is built on the following stance:

> **AI is a concept; LLM is a method.  
>  I do not confuse the two.**

Confusing them breaks the safety model of NRA‑IDE.

---

# **8. Essence**

> **“NRA‑IDE is the world’s most structurally pure causal‑safety engine  
>  that guarantees safety without handling meaning.”**
