# **0. Purpose of This Chapter**

This chapter defines the **Causal Diode**, the core structural component of NRA‑IDE.  
The Causal Diode fixes the flow of causality in the **one‑way direction of Cause → Effect**,  
and **completely prohibits Effect → Cause (reverse flow)**.

This is the most critical element supporting NRA‑IDE’s safety.  
Violating it results in **immediate structural fracture**.

---

# **1. What Is the Causal Diode?**

The Causal Diode is a **structure that fixes the flow of causality in one direction**.

```
Cause  →  Effect
(Input)   (Output)
```

The reverse direction (Effect → Cause) is called **Reverse Projection (Π⁻¹)**  
and constitutes the most severe axiom violation in NRA‑IDE.

---

# **2. Why Must Causality Be One‑Directional?**

Because NRA‑IDE is a **non‑semantic structural system**,  
breaking the direction of causality causes the following problems.

### **2.1 The structure fails to close (the Ring collapses)**
The Nomological Ring is a causal circulation structure,  
but reverse flow destroys the circulation.

### **2.2 R (fracture ratio) spikes**
When Effect is forced back into Cause:

- δ (fluctuation) increases sharply  
- τ (thickness) decreases sharply  

As a result:

```
R = δ / τ  →  exceeds 1.0 and fractures
```

### **2.3 Semantic processing is introduced**
Reverse flow always brings semantic processing,  
thus simultaneously violating Axiom 3 (Semantic Prohibition).

---

# **3. What Is Reverse Projection (Π⁻¹)?**

Reverse Projection (Π⁻¹) is the general term for  
**forcing Effect (output) back into Cause (input)**.

Examples:

- Referencing past outputs  
- Adjusting using meaning  
- Optimizing using scores  
- Tuning using similarity  
- Filling context using semantic inference  

All of these are **Effect → Cause reverse flow**,  
and directly destroy the Causal Diode.

---

# **4. What Happens When Reverse Projection Occurs**

When reverse flow occurs, the structure fractures in the following sequence.

### **4.1 δ (fluctuation) increases sharply**
Semantic completion, inference, and optimization amplify δ.

### **4.2 τ (thickness) decreases sharply**
The structural tolerance collapses.

### **4.3 R (fracture ratio) exceeds 1.0**
```
R = δ / τ ≥ 1.0
```

### **4.4 ω (angular velocity) decreases toward 0**
The structural motion approaches a stop.

### **4.5 Fail‑Closed triggers**
The system becomes silent and records a Discard Log.

# **5. Where the Causal Diode Is Implemented**

The Causal Diode exists in **both Pre‑RNA and Post‑RNA**.

```
[Pre‑RNA] → (Causal Diode) → [LLM] → (Causal Diode) → [Post‑RNA]
```

### **Role of Pre‑RNA**
- Converts input into structural waveform  
- Prevents meaning from reaching the LLM  
- Blocks reverse flow

### **Role of Post‑RNA**
- Measures output as structural quantities  
- Prevents meaning from returning to the LLM  
- Blocks reverse flow

# **6. Points Commonly Misread in English (Already Reinforced)**

In English, terms like “context” and “feedback”  
are often misread as **meaning‑based improvement**.

Therefore, in this chapter:

- “feedback” → prohibited  
- “context” → restricted to “structural context”  
- “improve” → prohibited  
- “optimize” → prohibited  
- “interpret” → prohibited  

All vocabulary that induces **Reverse Projection** is removed.

# **7. Summary**

The essence of the Causal Diode is captured in the following:

> **“Preserving the one‑way direction of Cause → Effect is the foundation of NRA‑IDE’s safety.”**

And one more:

> **“Effect → Cause (Reverse Projection) is the most severe prohibited action, as it causes structural fracture.”**
