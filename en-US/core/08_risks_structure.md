## **0. Introduction**

This chapter summarizes the **structural‑side risks** handled by NRA‑IDE.  
The focus here is not on meaning or use‑cases, but on  
**patterns in which the causal structure itself fractures**.

---

# **1. R ≥ 1.0 (Fracture of Causal Stability)**

R is the causal stability ratio computed as δ/τ.  
When R ≥ 1.0, the structure can no longer be maintained and fracture occurs.

- R < 1.0 → Stable  
- R = 1.0 → Critical  
- R > 1.0 → Fracture (Fail‑Closed)

---

# **2. ω = 0 (Loss of Structural Continuity)**

ω represents structural continuity (coherence).  
ω = 0 indicates that the structure has lost continuity—  
a **structural**, not semantic, form of fracture.

---

# **3. violation (Structural Violation)**

A violation occurs when the system reaches a state  
that is structurally impermissible.

A violation is not a semantic error;  
it is a **structural fracture point**.

# **4. semantic leakage**

Semantic leakage is the phenomenon in which meaning infiltrates the structural layer.  
It is one of the most dangerous forms of fracture.

- Meaning generated by the LLM backflows into Pre‑RNA  
- Causal structure is rewritten into semantic evaluation  
- R computation is destroyed  

Semantic leakage triggers **immediate Fail‑Closed**.

# **5. structure erosion**

Meaning, optimization, or history infiltrates the structural layer,  
gradually destroying the causal structure.

Characteristics:

- Deteriorates continuously  
- Fracture point is hard to detect  
- Often caused by human “convenience demands”  

---

# **6. curtain (Layer Thinning)**

Curtain refers to the thinning of the separation between  
Pre‑RNA / LLM / Post‑RNA, creating a dangerous state where backflow occurs.

Signs of Curtain:

- LLM begins influencing structural judgment  
- Post‑RNA begins referencing meaning  
- Pre‑RNA begins handling history  

Curtain is a precursor to structural fracture.

# **7. backflow**

Backflow is the phenomenon in which LLM meaning generation  
flows backward into the causal‑structure layer.

- Meaning infiltrates Pre‑RNA  
- Post‑RNA begins referencing meaning  
- R computation is destroyed  

Backflow is a breach of the **Causal Diode (Chapter 02)**  
and is a direct cause of structural fracture.

# **8. Essence**

> **Structural fracture is not a semantic mistake—  
> it is the collapse of the causal structure itself.**
