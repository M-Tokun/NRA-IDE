## **0. Introduction**

This chapter summarizes the points that  
**must never be misunderstood**  
and the actions that  
**must never be performed**  
when handling NRA‑IDE.

NRA‑IDE is a safety engine,  
not a use‑case engine.

This chapter exists to prevent misuse driven by human “desire.”

# **1. Do Not Make NRA‑IDE Handle Meaning**

NRA‑IDE **does not handle meaning**.  
Attempting to make it handle meaning causes structural fracture.

Prohibited actions:

- “Make it more natural”  
- “Make it semantically correct”  
- “Same as last time”  
- “Understand the context”  
- “Improve it”  

All of these are requests for **meaning, optimization, or history**,  
and lie outside the structure of NRA‑IDE.

---

# **2. Do Not Request Optimization**

NRA‑IDE **does not perform optimization**.  
Because no center exists,  
distance, score, and similarity cannot be defined.

Prohibited actions:

- “Make it better”  
- “Increase accuracy”  
- “Optimize it”  
- “Run an improvement cycle”  

These actions cause structural fracture.

# **3. Do Not Request History**

NRA‑IDE **does not reference past outputs**.  
Forcing it to handle history allows meaning to infiltrate  
and causes structural erosion.

Prohibited actions:

- “Continue from last time”  
- “Same style as before”  
- “Make it consistent”  

History lies outside the structure.

# **4. Do Not Treat the LLM as a Judgment Engine**

The LLM is a **language generation engine**,  
not responsible for judgment, safety, or responsibility.

Prohibited actions:

- “Let the LLM decide”  
- “Have the LLM make the judgment”  
- “Adopt the LLM output as is”  

Judgment is always performed by humans.

# **5. Do Not Misinterpret NRA‑IDE as a Universal Engine**

NRA‑IDE is **not a use‑case engine**.  
It does not describe or guarantee where it is useful.

Prohibited actions:

- “Tell me where it can be used”  
- “Can this be used in this industry?”  
- “Use it as if it were universal”  

Use‑case decisions are the responsibility of humans.

---

# **6. Avoid Misunderstandings About Copyright and Imitation**

NRA‑IDE **does not handle expression**.  
It handles only causal structure.

Prohibited actions:

- “Reproduce this author’s writing style”  
- “Imitate this work”  
- “Write like this character”  

What NRA‑IDE performs is  
**structural analysis and reconstruction by calculation**,  
not imitation or inference of expression.

---

# **7. Recognize Misuse Driven by Human “Desire”**

Humans naturally tend to:

- Assume something is universal if it looks convenient  
- Misinterpret AI as a judgment engine  
- Believe the LLM “understands”  
- Want improvement and optimization  

All of these cause structural fracture.

NRA‑IDE is a **structure designed to suppress human desire**.

# **8. Final Note: My Position on AI and LLM**

As a foundational premise of this system,  
I make the following stance explicit:

> **AI is a concept; LLM is a method.  
>  I do not confuse the two.**

If this distinction is misunderstood,  
safe operation of NRA‑IDE becomes impossible.

---

# **9. Essence**

> **“Misuse of NRA‑IDE begins with human desire.  
>  This warning note exists to suppress that desire.”**
