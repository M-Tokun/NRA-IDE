# Movie: Structural Verification of NRA-IDE

This folder contains video artifacts demonstrating the physical control capabilities of the **NRA-IDE (Nomological Ring Axioms)** framework.

## Featured Artifact: "The Sweater Paradox"
- **File:**  Towel blanket,Turtleneck-FACE,Warm sweate *.mp4
- **Model:** Gemini3.5pro (Phase-Synchronized)
- **Objective:** Verification of boundary maintenance and irreversible phase advancement.

### Why this is a "Proof," not just a "Video"
In conventional AI video generation, the action of "taking off a sweater" or "turtleneck movement" frequently leads to physical collapse (clipping, semantic melting, or time-reversal loops). These videos serve as visual evidence that NRA-IDE successfully maintains structural integrity under extreme constraints.

#### 1. Threshold Control of Thickness ($\tau$) and Fluctuation ($\delta$)
The core breakthrough demonstrated here is the stable control of the **Coherence Gate ($R = \delta / \tau$)**. Even during complex self-collisions, the system maintains a "Structural Silence" (Silence: $R \ge 100\%, \omega > 0$), preventing the fabric from penetrating the causal boundary of the body.

#### 2. Irreversible Phase ($\varphi$) Advancement
Observe the fluid motion of the hair and fabric. Unlike standard models that treat time as a reversible Circle, this simulation follows a **Spiral model**. Once the "Phase" of the sweater removal advances, the Causal Diode forbids any regression, ensuring a consistent physical arrow of time.

#### 3. Execution via RNA Box Sandwich
The generation process was isolated within an **RNA (Raw-logic Nomological Architecture)**.
- **Input Layer:** Constrains the AI's "Greed" for visual optimization.
- **Output Layer:** Validates the physical consistency of every frame against the axioms.
